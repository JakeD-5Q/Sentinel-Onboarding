# Analytical Rules

Analytical rules are responsible for the creation of Microsoft Sentinel incidents. This folder contains all of the rules that we use by default for all of our customers. These can be imported using the portal in the Analytics blade or the button below.

All templates can be deployed at the same time if you run the [deploy script](/Analytical%20Rules/deploy.ps1) but download or copy the [parameters file](/Analytical%20Rules/Azure_Sentinel_analytics_rules.parameters.json) and enter the name of the Azure Log Analytics Workspace that your Sentinel is located in. Now, you can run the script.

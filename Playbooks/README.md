# Sentinel Playbooks Automated Deployments

## Instructions

Each folder has a matching zip file.

Go to the desired Folder and view each file it contains. Inspect the parameters files that the values are correct.

Inspect the deploy script. *MAKE SURE THE AZURE ENVIRONMENT INFO IS INCLUDED/PROMPTS FOR IT HERE*

Once satisfied, zip this folder and you will upload it in 2 different ways.

1. Upload to a Github repository so that remote deploys can be made (the remote deploy script must be used)
    - alternatively, if all templates are made available a local script can deploy these templates.

    *Due to constant reconfiguration, this is not our chosen method.*


2. Upload to admin Cloud Shell, continue to deploy the templates locally from the unzipped directory
